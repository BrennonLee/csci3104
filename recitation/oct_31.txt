problem1
  Contradiction proofs

  part b)
    show that p --> q
      assume contradiction of q and logically go forward until you come across a contradiction.

  S1:
    prove t1 <= uj

        Suppose not, suppose t1 > uj.
        if t1 is greater than uj, then a celebrity will leave at uj and
        will not see the ad played at t1. Therefore not all the celebrities will see the ad played.
        This is a contradiction since each celebrity is supposed to see the ads.

        Also suggests that t2, t3, .... tk > uj

  s2:
    prove t1 <= li, it can be deleted and rest of ads form valid solution.

    1-assume invalid solution after deletion.
    2-which means that some celebrity is uncovered or doesnt see the ad.
    3-but every celebrity will see an ad since it implies t2, t3 ... tk <= li, so this is a contradiction since the solution is valid!

    suppose not, if t1 <= li


problem2
  use hashtable, then for each element in list, if T- fist value is equal to any other element in list, then you found a pair that add up to 28.

Problem 1
  a) For this given scenario and set of time intervals, there is only one solution that the greedy algorithm will select and that solution
        remains to be the best one.

  b)
      S1:
        prove t1 <= uj

            Suppose not, suppose t1 > uj.
            if t1 is greater than uj, then a celebrity will leave at uj and
            will not see the ad played at t1. If that is the case, then not all the celebrities will see the ad played.
            This is a contradiction since each celebrity is supposed to see an ad.

      S2:
        prove t1 < lj, it can be deleted and rest of ads form valid solution.

          Suppose not, suppose t1 < lj, it can be deleted and rest of the ads will NOT form a valid solution.
          If this is the case, then t1 will be deleted and a celebrity will be left uncovered. But we know this is not the case.
          Since lj represents the time when our first to leave celebrity enters, then we know that any time up until uj will form a valid solution time.
          Therefore this is a contradiction if t1 is deleted and the rest of the ads will not form a valid solution.

      S3:
        prove If t1 < uj then t1 can be modified to be equal to uj, while still remaining a valid solution.

          Suppose not, suppose t1<uj and t1 is modified to equal uj, Then it will NOT remain a valid solution.
          If this is the case, then t1 will equal uj. uj represents the earliest time that the first celebrity will leave.
          Since the end of the intervals are inclusive, this is a contradiction and t1 will still be a valid solution since every celebrity will see an ad.
